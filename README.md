# cmp - a number comparison website 🔒🤫

Welcome to **The Most Revolutionary** project of the century: a website where two users can compare numbers... in secret! Yes, you read that right, **in secret**. Because clearly, in this world of quantum computing and AI, comparing numbers privately is the challenge we were all waiting for. 🤯

## Features 🦸‍♂️

- **Compare numbers** – What more could you possibly want from life? You enter a number, the other person enters a number, and **voilà**! The website compares them... **IN SECRET** (because life is about those hidden truths we dare not speak).

- **Privacy** – Don’t worry, your deepest, darkest 42 will never be exposed to the world. We use the most advanced form of secrecy: **not telling anyone**. It’s basically magic. 🔮

- **Simple Interface** – We didn’t clutter your life with unnecessary buttons or features like "instructions" or "clarity." Who needs those? Just wing it.

## Usage 💡

1. Open [the website](https://cmp.shuttleapp.rs).
2. Enter a number. **Gasp** in awe as the magic happens behind the scenes.
3. Receive the result (which is basically "greater than" or "less than"). **Amazing**.

## Why This Exists 🧐

Why **does** this project exist? That’s the real secret. Maybe the world just needs another pointless way to secretly compare numbers, or maybe I had too much free time. Either way, you're welcome.

## Contributing 💻
